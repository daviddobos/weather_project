models:
  - name: s_fct_astro
    description: The s_fct_astro model provides detailed information about astronomical events such as moon phases, moon illumination, moonrise and moonset times, as well as sunrise and sunset times for different cities across various countries. The model also includes metadata such as the date the data was validated and the date it was extracted or updated. The data is sourced from the wh_weather database, specifically the b_astro table in the dbt_bronze schema and the country_codes table in the dbt_int schema. The model generates a unique key, astro_pk, for each record using the forecast date, country code, and city name.
    columns:

        description: This column represents the date of the forecast. It is used to understand when the forecasted astrological event is expected to occur.
        data_type: datetime2
      - name: city_nm
        description: This column represents the name of the city for which the astronomical data is recorded. It is a string type field and can be used to filter or group the data based on specific cities.
        data_type: varchar
      - name: city_fk
        description: A foreign key representing the unique identifier of a city in the `s_dim_city` dimension table. It is used to join forecast data with city-related metadata like county name.
        data_type: varchar
        data_tests:
          - relationships:
              name: s_fct_astro_rel_s_dim_city_city_fk
              to: ref('s_dim_city')
              field: city_pk 
      - name: country_cd
        description: This column represents the code of the country where the city is located. It is a string type field and can be used to filter or group the data based on specific countries. This code is standardized and can be used for joining with other datasets that use the same country coding system.
        data_type: varchar
        data_tests:
          - name: s_fct_astro_accepted_values_country_cd
            test_name: accepted_values
            values: ['HU']
      - name: country_nm
        description: This column represents the name of the country where the city is located. It is a string type field and can be used to filter or group the data based on specific countries. This field provides a more human-readable form of the country information compared to the country code.
        data_type: varchar
      - name: moon_illumination_pct
        description: This column represents the percentage of the moon's surface that is illuminated by the sun's light at a given time. It is a numerical value ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates a new moon (completely dark) and 100 indicates a full moon (completely illuminated).
        data_type: int
      - name: moon_phase_cd
        description: This column contains a code that represents the current phase of the moon. The moon goes through several phases in a month, from new moon to full moon and back again. This code helps to identify which phase the moon is in at a given time.
        data_type: varchar
      - name: moonrise_t
        description: This column indicates the time at which the moon rises above the horizon. The time is represented in the 24-hour format. Please note that the moonrise time can vary significantly depending on the geographical location and the phase of the moon.
        data_type: time
      - name: moonset_t
        description: This column represents the time at which the moon sets. It is expressed in local time of the city and country specified in the 'city_nm' and 'country_cd' columns respectively. This information can be useful for planning activities that are dependent on moonlight or for understanding the patterns of natural light in a particular location.
        data_type: time
      - name: sunrise_t
        description: This column indicates the time of sunrise. It is expressed in local time of the city and country specified in the 'city_nm' and 'country_cd' columns respectively. This information can be useful for planning activities that require daylight or for understanding the patterns of natural light in a particular location.
        data_type: time
      - name: sunset_t
        description: This column represents the time of sunset. It is expressed in local time of the city and country specified in the 'city_nm' and 'country_cd' columns respectively.
